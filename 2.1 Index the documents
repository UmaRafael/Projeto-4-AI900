After you have the documents in storage, you can use Azure AI Search to extract insights from the documents. The Azure portal provides an Import data wizard. With this wizard, you can automatically create an index and indexer for supported data sources. You’ll use the wizard to create an index, and import your search documents from storage into the Azure AI Search index.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure AI Search resource. On the Overview page, select Import data.

2. On the Connect to your data page, in the Data Source list, select Azure Blob Storage. Complete the data store details with the following values:
   Data Source: Azure Blob Storage
   Data source name: coffee-customer-data
   Data to extract: Content and metadata
   Parsing mode: Default
   Connection string: *Select Choose an existing connection. Select your storage account, select the coffee-reviews container, and then click Select.
   Managed identity authentication: None
   Container name: this setting is auto-populated after you choose an existing connection.
   Blob folder: Leave this blank.

4. In the Attach Cognitive Services section, select your Azure AI services resource.

5. In the Add enrichments section:
   Change the Skillset name to coffee-skillset.

   Change the Enrichment granularity level to Pages (5000 character chunks).

          Generate tags from images	 	imageTags
          Generate captions from images	 	imageCaption
          
6. Under Save enrichments to a knowledge store, select:
