Use the Search explorer to write and test queries. Search explorer is a tool built into the Azure portal that gives you an easy way to validate the quality of your search index. You can use Search explorer to write queries and review results in JSON.

1. In your Search service’s Overview page, select Search explorer at the top of the screen.

2. Notice how the index selected is the coffee-index you created. Below the index selected, change the view to JSON view.
   In the JSON query editor field, copy and paste:
      {
    "search": "*",
    "count": true
}

3. Select Search. The search query returns all the documents in the search index, including a count of all the documents in the @odata.count field. The search index should return a JSON document containing your search results.

   Now let’s filter by location. In the JSON query editor field, copy and paste:
     {
 "search": "locations:'Chicago'",
 "count": true
}

4. Select Search. The query searches all the documents in the index and filters for reviews with a Chicago location. You should see 3 in the @odata.count field.

   Now let’s filter by sentiment. In the JSON query editor field, copy and paste:
   {
 "search": "sentiment:'negative'",
 "count": true
}
5. Select Search. The query searches all the documents in the index and filters for reviews with a negative sentiment. You should see 1 in the @odata.count field.

6. One of the problems we might want to solve for is why there might be certain reviews. Let’s take a look at the key phrases associated with the negative review. What do you think might be the cause of the review?
